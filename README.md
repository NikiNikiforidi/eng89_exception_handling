# Working with files

### Exception handling
### File permissions

#### Example of some errors/exceptions
- `value error`
- `syntax error`
- `outof bounds`
- `key error `
- `attribute error`
- `zeroDivison error`


#### File permissions

- `r` This is the default mode. It opens file for reading
- `w` This mode opens files for writing. If file doesn't exist, it creates a new file for us.
- `x` Creates a new file, id already exists the operation fails
- `a` Opens the file in Append Mode, if file does not exist, it creates a new one
- `t` This is the default mode to open in text mode
- `b` This is for binary mode
- `+` this will open a file for reading and writing (updating)


**We have `try` `except` and `finally`**
- `try` works as `if` condition
- `exept` works as `elif`
- `finally` works as `else`. `Finally` will execute regardless of `try` and `except` conditions
